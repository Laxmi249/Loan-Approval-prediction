# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction

This project uses Python and machine learning to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant data. It is built in a Jupyter Notebook and is ideal for those interested in data analytics and predictive modeling.

📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to apply data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and classification algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts loan approval decisions.

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains information on:

Applicant's income

Education

Marital status

Credit history

Loan amount and term

Property area
...and other relevant features that influence loan approval.

🧰 Technologies & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas – data handling

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization

Scikit-learn – machine learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)

📈 Workflow

Data Loading

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Model Building

Model Evaluation

▶️ How to Run

Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/loan-approval-prediction.git
cd loan-approval-prediction
Open the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook Loan\ Approval\ Prediction.ipynb
Run all cells to see the complete analysis and model results.

✅ Outcome
This project demonstrates how data-driven decisions can support loan approval processes using predictive modeling techniques. It is a useful foundation for data analysts and ML beginners interested in real-world classification problems.
